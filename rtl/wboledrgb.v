// Project:	OpenArty, an entirely open SoC based upon the Arty platform
//
// Purpose:	To provide a *very* simplified controller for a PMod OLEDrgb.
//		This controller implements four registers (described below),
//	although it might feel like only two in practice.  As with all of our
//	other wishbone work, all transactions are 32-bits--even though, as an
//	example, the data word for the device is only ever 16-bits long.
//
//	The device control, outlined below, is also colored by two facts:
//	1. There is no means to read from the device.  Sure, the chip on the 
//		PMod has a full read/write bus, but it hasn't been entirely
//		wired to the PMod pins.  This was probably done so that the
//		interface could handle the paucity of pins available, but for
//		whatever reason, there's no way to read from the device.
//	2. The device is controlled by a SPI port, but with an extra wire that
//		determines whether or not you are writing to the control or the
//		data port on the device.  Hence the four wire SPI protocol has
//		lost the MISO wire and gained a Data / Control (N) (or dcn)
//		wire.
//	3. As implemented, the device also has two power control wires and a
//		reset wire.  The reset wire is negative logic.  Without setting
//		the PMOD-Enable wire high, the board has no power.  The
//		VCCEN pin is not to be set high without PMOD-Enable high.
//		Finally, setting reset low (with PMod-Enable high), places the
//		device into a reset condition.
//
//	The design of the controller, as with the design of other controllers
//	we have built, is focused around the design principles:
//	1. Use the bottom 23 bits of a word for the command, if possible.
//		Such commands can be loaded into registers with simple LDI
//		instructions.  Even better, restrict any status results from the
//		device to 18 bits, so that instructions that use immediates
//		such as TEST #,Rx, can use these immediates.
//	2. Protect against inadvertant changes to the power port.  For this,
//		we insist that a minimum of two bits be high to change the
//		power port bits, and that just reading from the port and
//		writing back with a changed power bit is not sufficient to
//		change the power.
//	3. Permit atomic changes to the individual power control bits,
//		by outlining which exact bits change upon any write, and
//		permitting only the bits specified to change.
//	4. Don't stall the bus.  So, if a command comes in and the
//		device is busy, we'll ignore the command.  It is up to the
//		user to make certain the device isn't fed faster than it is
//		able.  (Perhaps the user wishes to add a FIFO?)
//	5. Finally, build this so that either a FIFO or DMA could control it.
//
// Registers:
//	0. Control	-- There are several types of control commands to/from
//		the device, all separated and determined by how many bytes are
//		to be sent to the device for the said command.  Commands written
//		to the control port of the device are initiated by writes
//		to this register.
//
//		- Writes of all { 24'h00, data[7:0] } send the single byte
//			data[7:0] to the device.
//		- Writes of     { 16'h01, data[15:0] } send two bytes,
//			data[15:0], to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h2, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send three bytes,
//			data[23:0], to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h3, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send four bytes,
//			data[23:0], then r_a[31:24] to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h3, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send five bytes,
//			data[23:0], then r_a[31:16] to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h3, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send six bytes,
//			data[23:0], then r_a[31:8] to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h3, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send seven bytes,
//			data[23:0], then r_a[31:0] to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h3, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send eight bytes,
//			data[23:0], r_a[31:16], then r_b[31:24] to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h3, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send nine bytes,
//			data[23:0], r_a[31:16], then r_b[31:16] to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h3, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send ten bytes,
//			data[23:0], r_a[31:16], then r_b[31:8] to the device.
//		- Writes of     {  4'h3, 4'hx, data[23:0] } send eleven bytes,
//			data[23:0], r_a[31:16], then r_b[31:0] to the device.
//
//	1. A	This register is used, just like the B register below, for
//		setting up commands that send multiple bytes to the device.
//		Be aware that the high order bits/bytes will be sent first.
//		This is one of the few registers that may be read with meaning.
//		Once the word is written, however, the register is cleared.
//
//	2. B	This is the same as the A register, save on writes the A
//		register will be written first before any bits from the B
//		register.  As with the A register, this value is cleared upon
//		any write--regardless of whether its value is used in the
//		write.
//
//	3. Data	--- This is both the data and the power control register.
//
//		To write data to the graphics data RAM within the device,
//		simply write a 16'bit word: { 16'h00, data[15:0] } to this
//		port.
//
//		To change the three power bits, {reset, vccen, pmoden},
//		you must also set a 1'b1 in the corresponding bit position from
//		bit 16-18.  Hence a:
//
//		32'h010001 sets the pmod enable bit, whereas 32'h010000 clears
//			it.
//		32'h020002 sets the vcc bit, whereas 32'h010000 clears it.
//
//		Multiple of the power bits can be changed at once.  Each 
//		respective bit is only changed if it's change enable bit is
//		also high.
