## Project:	OpenArty, an entirely open SoC based upon the Arty platform
##
## Purpose:	Describes how to integrate a wishbone scope, focused on the
##		ZipCPU, into our platform.  This is good for debugging things
##	if the CPU itself isn't working.
##
##	If you include this within your design, you should also find an
##	associated piece of software to decode the signals produced by this
##	scope within the repository (check in the sw/host directory).
